Crystal Energy began as a response to a growing need from consumers in the oil and gas industry. Businesses needed products that were both safer and more efficient than the alternatives available at the time. As for residential customers, current products in the solar business had proven to be inefficient. Crystal Energy was founded with these two industries in mind – oil & gas technicians would benefit from wearable electrical protective equipment (EPE) units with rubber masks that fit comfortably over their faces as well as being liquidtight, while homeowners would enjoy home energy systems that are designed to harness natural energy sources to ultimately decrease their energy bills.

We are leading manufacturer and supplier of Crystal Energy which is an efficient energy that is used to meet increasing demand for electricity. Our Crystal Energy adheres to the highest standards of quality, technicality and reliability

Ion-charged Ozone is a unique and necessary component of the natural environment. It is part of the upper atmosphere and protects life against biologically damaging ultraviolet rays. It is formed in the stratosphere, at an altitude of twenty to thirty kilometers, where the temperature is - 80°C. The ion-charged ozone then gradually descends down to the earth under the influence of gravity and natural air currents. This powerful cleaning force can return water, that has been polluted by harmful industrial emissions, algae or microorganisms in fresh water tanks to its original state within 24 hours. It also purifies stagnant water in swimming pools or ponds in a few hours. The installation is very easy and multi functional; it can be used as an air cleaner or highly effective sterilizer for all kinds of water using one unit only! At Crystal Energy we are dedicated to making products that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, we have focused our attention on products for industries such as oil, gas & chemical plants, nuclear industry and medical facilities.

Crystal Energy manufactures products in 3 different industries. We specialize in manufacturing bulkheads, multi-compartment tanks, custom vessels and a variety of storage tanks. These include, but are not limited to: oil & gas storage tank, water, (above ground and below ground) hazardous and non-hazardous storage tanks.

Crystal Energy started because of a need for a healthier environment. It all began with disposable, single-use products like gloves or leather masks that were expensive, harmful to the environment and had to be replaced constantly. We found an alternative in traditional materials like rubber, which is not only biodegradable but also provides better comfort and safety.

 Crystal Energy was founded in 1970s as a research and design center for electrical products. Now, we're also a major stockholder of a Shanghai listed public company, integrating designing, researching, manufacturing and importing & exporting business. 

 Our mission is to make your house more energy efficient and make you more money. We have a variety of products from solar panels to rubber masks that allow you to work comfortably without wasting time.

  Crystal Energy is the first home solar product for the everyday homeowner. When you buy our system, you are not just buying a product, but also buying peace of mind and saving money on your monthly energy bill. We are committed to providing quality products with great service.

  Crystal Energy was founded by concerned consumers who wanted to create safer and more efficient products for the oil and gas and residential solar industries. Our heart for these industries motivated us to create systems that use natural energy sources we can rely on.
